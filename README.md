# Engineering Career Ladder

[Roles and Levels](roles.md) | [Competencies](competencies.md)

This builds on [great work from Etsy](https://github.com/etsy/Etsy-Engineering-Career-Ladder) around how to get ahead at Etsy. I've found that until a company has a framework as detailed as this most career advancement is on individual engineers to figure out their path through to mastery. This is intended as a tool to be your personal Career ladder.
